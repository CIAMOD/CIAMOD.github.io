# Markov Triples and Their Relation to Higgs Moduli Spaces

## Overview
Markov triples are solutions to \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz \). Generalized m-triples solve 
\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz + m \). We study these integer solutions, their growth, and 
connections to parabolic Higgs moduli via Non-Abelian Hodge Theory.
